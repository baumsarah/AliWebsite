        <p>For real though...</p>
        <p>I can't even begin to explain how much you mean to me and literally so much of the world, Ali. You are so incredibly special and everything you are is everything that I, and many others, aspire to be. You work so unspeakably hard to accomplish everything you set your mind to and then you make it happen! You see how you can most effectively have an impact, and then you go full speed ahead to carry out whatever that is. And you always, always put others before yourself. You're always the first to check in with someone when they seem a bit off. You write people letters, long texts, and as someone who's received one before, I know just how special they can make people feel. But, in my opinion, every day should be about YOU, especially when you're in a week as hard as this one. So thank you thank you thank you for texting me and letting me know what you need, and I will try to think and act more like you so that I can be the best friend that I can possibly be, because that is exactly what you are.</p>
