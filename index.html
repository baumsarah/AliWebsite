        <h1>Hi, Ali!</h1>
        <p>I know this is a hard time of year for you. So I thought... hmmmm... what can I do to bring Alison a smile today?</p>
        <p>So, naturally, I wondered what would Ali do if she were in my position?</p>
        <p>Well, she'd probably make me a website! So that's exactly what I did.</p>
        <p>I thus present to you my very second website ever.</p>
        <p>It will most definitely give your a computer a virus if that illegal site you use to watch things hasn't done that by the time you're reading this.</p>
